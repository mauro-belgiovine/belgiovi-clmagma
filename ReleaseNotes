             clMAGMA Release Notes
	
-----------------------------------------------------

clMAGMA is an OpenCL port of MAGMA, intended for a single GPU. 
It supports AMD GPUs. 

Included are routines for the following algorithms:

    * LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations in both real and complex
      arithmetic (single and double);
    * Hessenberg, bidiagonal, and tridiagonal reductions in both real
      and complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Linear solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Eigen and singular value problem solvers in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Orthogonal transformation routines.

 1.0.0 - 10-24-2012
    * Add eigen and singular value problem solvers in both real and
      complex arithmetic, single and double (routines magma_z|c}heevd,
      magma_{d|s}syevd, magma_{z|c|d|s}geev, and magma_{z|c|d|s}gesvd) ;
    * Add matrix inversion routines (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}trtri_gpu,
      magma_{z|c|d|s}getri_gpu, magma_{z|c|d|s}potri_gpu);
    * Add orthogonal transformations routines ({z|c}unmqr_gpu,
      {d|s}ormqr_gpu, {z|c}ungqr, {d|s}orgqr, {z|c}unmtr, {d|s}ormtr,
      {z|c}unmqr, {d|s}ormqr, {z|c}unmql, {d|s}ormql, {z|c}unghr,
      and {d|s}orghr).

      transformations (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}gebrd )

      ( routines magma_{zhe|che|dsy|ssy}trd )

 0.2.0 - 05-26-2012
    * Change GPU_TARGET in make.inc to descriptive name (e.g., AMD).
    * Added solvers for general and symmetric matrices 
    * Added least squares solver
    * Added multiple precision support for LU factorization
    * All routines provided in this release support s/d/c/z
